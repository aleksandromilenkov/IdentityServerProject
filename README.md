This is Duende Identity Server project.  
I'm using OpenIDConnect to connect to my Identity Server.  
There are 3 projects: The IdentityServer project, ASP.NET MVC which is the client and ASP.NET Web API which is the API.  
There is also support for Windows and Facebook logins.  
Also there are few policies implemented.  
I'm using Reference Tokens because those can be revoked.  
I'm using SQL Lite where I store my users.
